    <h3>Write The Difference Between var and const with code example.</h3>

    <h3> 
        Results:
    </h3>

    <h3>The Variables declared using the var can be updated and also re-declared within its scope 
        <br> While the variable declared using the let can be updated but not re-declared
        <br> but the variables declared using const can not we updated and re-declared
        <br> This is the main difference between the var, let, and const
    </h3>

    <h3> For Example: </h3>
    
    <h3> Example Of var </h3>
    <h3> var car = "BMW";</h3>
    <h3> var car = "Logan";</h3>
    <h3> The var car has firstly "BMW" as declaration after that the var car has re-declared name which is "Logan" and it will print "Logan" in place of "BMW" after declaration.</h3>
    
    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>
    
    <h3> Example Of let </h3>
    <h3> let car = "BMW";</h3>
    <h3> let car = "Logan";</h3>
    <h3> In the example above the after re-declaration. if we try to print the car variable it will not print because the let can only update the variable not re- declare it,</h3>

    <br>
    <hr>
    <br>

    <h3> Example Of const </h3>
    <h3> const car = "BWM";</h3>
    <h3> const car = "Logan":</h3>
    <h3> In the example above the const variable car will not print beacuse the const variables niether can be updated and nor re-declared</h3>

    <h3>Write a brief intro on available datatypes in Javascript</h3>

    <h3>
        Results:
    </h3>

    <h3> There are six basic types of datatypes in Javascript: </h3>

    <h3> 
        1) String <br>
        
        Example: var car = "BMW";  // This is a String which is group of words.
    </h3>

    <h3> 
        2) Numbers <br>
        
        Example: var car_num = 3;  // This is a Number which is a number.
    </h3>

    <h3> 
        3) Boolean <br>
        
        Example: var car = True ;// This is a Boolean which contains only True and False value
    </h3>

    <h3> 
        4) Object <br>
        
        Example: var car = { name : "BMW", modal : 4}; // This is a Object which is group of named values
    </h3>

    <h3> 
        5) Arrays <br>
        
        Example: var car = ["BMW, Logan, Hector"]; // This is a Arrays which can store multiple values in only single variable
    </h3>

    <h3> 
        6) Null <br>
        
        // A null is nothing, it is supposed to be something that doesn't exist
    </h3>
